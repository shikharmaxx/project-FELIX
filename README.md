# project-FRIDAY
Virtual assistant 'FRIDAY' developed using python text to speech and Microsoft's speech API inspired by Iron man's AI of the same name. 
FRIDAY detects **user's voice**, converts it into string and detects the command and execute it.

Some of the **funcitons** FRIDAY can perform : 
  1. Search about topic on Wikipedia
  2. Open specific websites on google
  3. Search about query on goole
  4. Open programs on user's windows computer
  


Several **modules** are used to make this program but mainly **pyttsx3** and **speech_recognition** is used.
Other modules such as webbrowser and os are used so that FRIDAY can do various actions on your device.
Datetime and Random module is also used for some functions.

  
**AREA OF IMPROVEMENT**

This project is hardcoded and in future, I will apply machine learning and natural langauge processing to increase efficiency.
