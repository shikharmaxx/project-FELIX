# project-FRIDAY
Virtual assistant 'FRIDAY' developed using python text to speech and Microsoft's speech API inspired by Iron man's AI of the same name. This project is hardcoded and in future, I will apply machine learning to increase efficiency and implement it on raspberry pi.

Several modules are used to make this program but mainly pyttsx3 and speech_recognition is used.
Other modules such as webbrowser and os are used so that FRIDAY can do various actions on your device.
Datetime and Random module is also used for some functions.
